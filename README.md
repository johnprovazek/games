## Usage

### Power User Mode

This project has a power user mode option. This can be enabled by pressing the **enable power use mode** button on the bottom of the page.
Power user mode allows users to reorder the games list.
It also allows opening multiple links at once.
This is done by selecting the checkboxes on each game and pressing the **open selected** button at the top of the page.
Power user mode needs users to allow pop-ups for the site to open multiple links at once.

#### Safari on iOS

Safari on iOS allows enabling pop-ups globally but not on a per site basis.
Due to this the power user mode has been disabled for Safari on iOS users.
This is to prevent users from turning on pop-ups globally, which is a bad practice.
